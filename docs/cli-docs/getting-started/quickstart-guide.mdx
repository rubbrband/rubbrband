## **Installation**

Rubbrband can be installed through pip.

```bash
pip install rubbrband
```

## Example Usage

To get a feel for finetuning Dreambooth, you can copy and paste these lines in your terminal to start finetuning. This script will finetune a Dreambooth model to learn a specific man's face. 

```bash
# install rubbrband
pip install rubbrband

# download dummy dataset and set folder structure
git clone https://github.com/rubbrband/sample_dataset.git
git clone https://github.com/JoePenna/Stable-Diffusion-Regularization-Images.git --depth 1
mkdir regDir
mv ./Stable-Diffusion-Regularization-Images/man_unsplash ./regDir/man

# start training
rubbrband train dreambooth --class-word man --dataset-dir ./sample_dataset --reg-dir ./regDir --log-dir ./logs
```
