## **What is ControlNet?**

ControlNet is a generative model with the ability to create images conditioned on more constraints than was possible before.

Previously, DreamBooth and Stable Diffusion models would be able to generate images given a text prompt. But what if you wanted a very specific image for a given prompt? For instance, for the prompt `a lighthouse in the sea` , you wanted to the lighthouse to be in the top right of the screen, with a certain height to it? 

With previous image generation models, there was no way to control the outputs other than through the text prompt.

With **ControlNet,** you'll be able to pass in a text prompt, and an image that you want the output to look like.

For instance, for the text prompt `bird` you'll be able to pass in an outline of the bird you want, like this:


![](/images/cli-docs/models/ControlNet1.png)


and you should get images like this as the output:


![](/images/cli-docs/models/ControlNet2.png)

## Training with a sample dataset

```bash
rubbrband launch control

# Download some sample data
wget https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/resolve/main/training/fill50k.zip
unzip fill50k.zip

rubbrband train control --dataset-dir ./fill50k
```

Checkpoints are saved to `~/ControlNet/lightning_logs/version_0/checkpoints` in the container.

To access it:

```bash
rubbrband enter control
cd ~/ControlNet/lightning_logs/version_0/checkpoints
```

## Dataset Format

In order to train **ControlNet**, the dataset folder needs to be structured in a specific way.

The model creators have created a sample dataset called `fill50k` which is shown above. You can replicate that folder structure as shown here:

```bash
.
├── prompt.json             # a json file mapping source to target, with a prompt
├── source                  # Source files
│   ├── 0.png               # Source Image 0
│   ├── 1.png               # Source Image 1
│   └── ...                 # etc.
├── target                  # Target files
│   ├── 0.png               # Target Image 0
│   ├── 1.png               # Target Image 1
│   └── ...                 # etc.
└── ...
```

`prompt.json` is a json file that indicates to the model how source files should map to target files. 

**Important: This file should include each entry as a single line and** **_it should not be properly formatted as a JSON_** **. Here are the first three lines of the sample file:**

```bash
{"source": "source/0.png", "target": "target/0.png", "prompt": "pale golden rod circle with old lace background"}
{"source": "source/1.png", "target": "target/1.png", "prompt": "light coral circle with white background"}
{"source": "source/2.png", "target": "target/2.png", "prompt": "aqua circle with light pink background"}
```
