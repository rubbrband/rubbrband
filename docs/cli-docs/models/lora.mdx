## **Training (Finetuning)**

To train LoRA, add some images to a folder named `data`. The author recommends about 7-10 images for good results.

```bash
rubbrband launch lora

# data folder should contain 5-10 images you want to finetune. 
# you should use jpg or png files. 768x768 images are recommended.

rubbrband train lora --dataset_dir="./data" 
```

For reference, training on an **RTX 3090** takes \~20 min for 1k steps.

****

## Inference

After doing a training run on LoRA, run the `rubbrband eval` command.

```bash
rubbrband launch lora
rubbrband eval lora --input-prompt "a man on the moon in style of <s1><s2>"
```


## Where are my outputs?

To view the output image on your local machine

```bash
rubbrband copy-from lora /home/engineering/samples/output.jpg ./data
```

To copy the checkpoint safetensor file onto your local machine, run the following:

```bash
rubbrband copy-from lora /home/engineering/output/final_lora.safetensors ./data
```
