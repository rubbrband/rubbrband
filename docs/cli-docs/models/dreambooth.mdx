## What is Dreambooth?

* Dreambooth is a method of personalizing text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion.

* Dreambooth personalizes Stable Diffusion by fine tuning on a small set of reference images (around 3-5 images) that you provide.

* Current models such as Stable Diffusion produce high-quality images, but it struggles to make new versions of your data in different settings or poses.


## How Does Dreambooth Work?

* During fine-tuning, Dreambooth learns to recognize unique features of your data.

* The model associates an identifier (called `sks`) to your unique features.

* The `sks` identifier allows the model to embed your unique features into the output domain of the model.

* The `sks` identifier will be used to synthesize photorealistic images of your features in different scenes or poses.

* The `sks` identifier was chosen randomly, because it is a rare word in the English dictionary.


## Training with a sample dataset

</Frame>


* Please download the images of the dog [found here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BO%5Fdyz-p65qhBRRMRA4TbZ8qW4rB99JZ) to the `--dataset-dir` folder.

* `--class-word` describes what images in your dataset contain (in this example, the dataset contains dog photos).

* `--regularization-prompt` describes the type of images you want to generate.

* Make a directory with `mkdir logs` and pass in the directory as `--log-dir` to get logs in that directory.

* We set sensible defaults for the steps, batch size, and learning rate. Refer to [How do I change default settings?](/cli-docs/models/dreambooth#how-do-i-change-default-settings) for more information.

```bash
rubbrband train dreambooth --dataset-dir="./data" \
--class-word="dog" \
--regularization-prompt="a photo of a dog"
--log-dir logs
```


## Inference on sample prompts

</Frame> 

* After doing a training run on Dreambooth, run the `rubbrband eval` command.

* In the `--input-prompt`, make sure the `class-word` (e.g. dog) is in the prompt.

* In the `--input-prompt`, make sure the `sks` identifier is in the prompt.  
   * For more information on what `sks` means, refer to [How Does Dreambooth Work?](/cli-docs/models/dreambooth#how-does-dreambooth-work)

```bash
rubbrband eval dreambooth --input-prompt "sks dog on the beach"
```


## Where are my outputs?

* To save the output image on your local machine

```bash
rubbrband copy-from dreambooth /home/engineering/samples/ ./data
```

* The checkpoint file is already on your local machine inside the `--log-dir`

## How do I change default settings?

* Dreambooth fine tuning is very sensitive and may require changing the default settings to get good outputs.

* This [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/dreambooth) covers some of the settings that have been found to work well.
