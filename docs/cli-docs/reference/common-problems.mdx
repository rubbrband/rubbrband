**`command not found: rubbrband`**

If you get this error after you have already installed rubbrband, you likely need to add your python dependencies folder to your PATH variable.

To solve this, use the following as reference:

```
$ which rubbrband
/usr/local/bin/rubbrband

// replace /usr/local/bin with the actual folder that holds rubbrband
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```


**`Docker is not running as root. Please start Docker or run sudo su root`**

If you get this error, you need to install Docker.
